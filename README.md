# EAT-DA-PIZZA

Eat-Da-Pizza is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of pizzas they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a pizza's name, it is displayed the pizza on one side of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each pizza in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the pizza will move to the devoured. Your app will store every pizza in a database, whether devoured or not.

This application is a pizza logger created using Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The app's architecture follows the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
